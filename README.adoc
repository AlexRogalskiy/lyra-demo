= Celesta Demo

This project demonstrates the simple RESTful service based on relational DB using https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/celesta[Celesta] and http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot].

== Build and Test

To build the project, run `mvn verify`: code for cursor classes will be generated in `target\generated-sources\celesta\...` folder. Then you may run the Spring Boot application in `App` class.

This application exports two REST handlers.

* 'Save an order to database' by sending `PUT` method to `http://localhost:8080/api/save` with the following content:

```json
{
	"id": "no1",
	"date": "2017-01-02",
	"customerId": "CUST1",
	"customerName": "John Doe",
	"lines": [{
			"itemId": "A",
			"qty": 5
		},
		{
			"itemId": "B",
			"qty": 4
		}
	]
}
```
* 'Obtain the totals report' by sending GET to `http://localhost:8080/api/report`, and receive something like
this:

```json
{
   "A": 10,
   "B": 8
}
```

== Database Structure

Database definition file is https://github.com/inponomarev/celesta-demo/blob/master/src/main/resources/score/ru/curs/demo/demo.sql[demo.sql].

You can try to modify it and re-run the application on non-empty database (see below how to connect to PostgreSQL) to test the automatic migration facility.

== Unit tests

See how service layer is tested in https://github.com/inponomarev/celesta-demo/blob/master/src/test/java/ru/curs/demo/service/DocumentServiceTest.java[`DocumentServiceTest`].

The test class is annotated with `@CelestaTest`, and each test method has `CallContext` parameter. Behind the scenes
Celesta runs with in-memory H2 database and the correct CallContext is provided for your tests.

== Using 'real' database connection

This application by default runs on H2-in-memory DB.

You may try to use any other RDBMS supported by Celesta, e. g. PostgreSQL. In order to do this, first create an empty database on your server (e. g. named
`celesta`).

Database connection is set in https://github.com/inponomarev/celesta-demo/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml[application.yml] file. Instead of

```yaml
celesta:
  h2:
    inMemory: true
```

you may write

```yaml
celesta:
  jdbc:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/celesta
    username: <your_username>
    password: <your_password>
```

(see https://courseorchestra.github.io/celesta/#basic_settings_section[Celesta documentation] for complete Celesta options
reference).

To start the application with connection to PostgreSQL you will also need PostgreSQL JDBC driver, which you can
simply add to dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```
